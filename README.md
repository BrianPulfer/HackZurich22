Repository for the HackZürich 2022 edition (September 16 - 18, 2022).

## Description
![](overview.png "Final application")
Supply chains are subject to disruptions of various types: climate disaster, socio-economical and political events, and so on. Such events can cause the shortages of goods in our supermarkets. To react quickly to such events, or better yet, to anticipate them, Migros could use a software that automatically scans for such threats and keeps the company aware.

Our **migros' monitor system** uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) Machine Learning models to translate and analyse news articles freshly fetched from the web, and classify each notion as a threat for our local company. Threats are displayed through our web interface, which provides a summary of the news the NLP model has read and a link to such resources, as well as a classification of the information.

We fatch the news articles from trusted URLs. We use [Huggingface's](https://www.huggingface.co) pre-trained models to translate, summarize and classify news articles. Only articles that are classified as a threat are displayed in our web  [React](https://www.reactjs.org) interface. The web interface shows a world map ([react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)) with annotations on suppliers which are at risk of some sort of shortage / raise in products price.
